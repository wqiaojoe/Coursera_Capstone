    "Crime rate is believed to be highly related to economy. The economic crisis that happened in 2008 is the turning point of the world, especially the US. Therefore, it is meaningful to study whether this turning point has affected the crime rate from the real data and how crime rate impacts the population and income.\n",

The objective of the project is to provide an insight of the crime data scraped from Chicago Data Portal and conclude the impact of 2008 crisis on Chicago's crime rate. Additionally, the census data of Chicago from 2008 to 2012 will be investigated to find the impact of crime, particularly after 2008, on the population and economy of individual community and the whole city."

    "This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” by Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012. The indicators are the percent of occupied housing units with more than one person per room (i.e., crowded housing); the percent of households living below the federal poverty level; the percent of persons in the labor force over the age of 16 years that are unemployed; the percent of persons over the age of 25 years without a high school diploma; the percent of the population under 18 or over 64 years of age (i.e., dependency); and per capita income. Indicators for Chicago as a whole are provided in the final row of the table.\n",

Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system.\n",

    "Chicago Crime Data will be used to obtain a comprehensive understanding of crime rate from 2004 to 2012 including the trend, types of crimes, crime rate of different communities and so on. Data visualization will help to achieve this goal. Census data of all the communities of Chicago will be jointly considered to give a clear picture of the connection of community population and income to crime rat of that area.\n",
